Since I have been described (even self-described) as an associate and was formally a partner to BG, although very much not an architect, a bit of explanation 
of that will lead to a bit of description of his thoughts as he discussed them
with me, of what "a practice" seemed to mean to him.
</p><p>
In the early 60s in Bartlesville BG began to "take stock" of what he had
accomplished and what he could accomplish in the future.  It was clear to
me that although he certainly knew he had produced wonderful work, he also
knew there was so much more in him that had shown itself only to those who
already understood him to a degree.  A remark that I recall as being quite
incisive was that of a critic who stated "Goff deserves to build a large
building on a conspicuous site and thus silence both his critics and admirers".
</p><p>

His early career had been under the (guidance, protection, tutelage?) of
a large established architecural firm Rush, Endicott, and Rush, and later
for a short time he had a partnership with Endicott (who was the structural
engineer of the firm and an authentic character from whom BG may have 
"inherited" his love of fun and jokes:-).  He then along with the entire
world ran into the Depression and a bad situation.  Some of his experiences
as Design Director of Libby Owens Ford glass company (or whatever the title
was - always look in deLong for more accurate information) were positive,
as was other work such as that with Ianelli during that time.

</p><p>
During the Second World War he accomplished some amazing things under the
circumstances, and later re-began an architectural career in Berkeley
after the war that produced some of his best designs (several of us have
recalled his particular love of the Leidig or "lily-pad" house among his
many creations).  But he did not get much built.

</p><p>
The time at Oklahoma, incredibly productive especially as far as its effect
upon students, did also produce some great designs (you can all name them,
I suspect, such as the Crystal Chapel) and one of the most amazing works
ever built (perhaps physically due mostly to its owner Gene Bavinger,
but certainly also due to BG's incredible imagination). As a side note,
BG always told me that Eric Mendelsohn recommended him for the job -
as an academic it is amazing that someone without even a bachelor's degree
was accepted initially for such a position, and a credit to the President
of the University which attracted him there (according to BG "to help build
a university the football team could be proud of").

</p><p>
After OU and in Bartlesville he became somewhat reflective about his career
(not to imply he had not reflected before, of course). In the early 60's
we began to talk quite a lot about phases of his career, and how he felt
about what he had accomplished or not accomplished in each, along with
what kind of a working environment he felt would be best at least for a while in the future.

</p><p>
A clear option was to again become deeply involved with a University, focus
on teaching (there has never been anyone better in many opinions), along with
occasional built works (and you never know when a big one might come along),
and whatever works of imagination he desired to produce.
</p><p>

Another option was to connect with some other firm (perhaps a "big one"
that would like to have a "name" designer).  There were a variety of problems
associated with that which many of us can understand.  At Rush (I will just
abbreviate it that way) he was well understood and appreciated, had grown
up within their system, and did not have to worry about being "undercut"
in some way.  Those who knew BG know that real actual innocence was one of
his most characteristic traits: he knew from much experience what the worst
could be, but very understandably wished to avoid potential bitterness in
any way possible.

</p><p>
A related possibility was to have "his own" firm, which of course he did,
but to try to operate it in a somewhat more formal manner, shall we say.
An issue certainly was to have one or more others who he literally trusted
to work with.  There were several former students certainly to be considered,
but for various reasons did not seem to be available and/or interested. For
one thing most were establishing their own career as architects, and he was
very very strong that they needed to work in their "own" way and not trying
to follow him.  A favorite topic of discussion was always the remark of
Claude Debussy that "the Debussyists are killing me", probably made in
relation to the battles of the "followers" of Debussy and Ravel, none who
lived up to the quality of their supposed "leaders".

</p><p>
We also discussed with several business, lawyerly, and financial folks who
he was willing to trust.  It seemed to me that most of them did not realize
that "the great man" could have such problems.

</p><p>
At some point (perhaps out of desperation) I ended up willing to start taking
the chance.  I did not and do not see myself as very qualified, except perhaps
that I cared very deeply about his work, and believe he understood and trusted
me very much.  It was clear to both of us that there would never be questions
about design or "credit" for it, and that I would never challenge him on that

</p><p>
As a sidenote in my mind I challenged him about ordinary matters more than most.I always had the feeling that so many of those who worshipped him (as I did) would out of respect feel compelled to agree with him even when they should not.
I used to say to myself if he would say "We don't need a roof, it never rains here" they would question it for a bit but finally just yield and say "well, it's his, not mine, he wins".
In my mind the fact that I was not and did not intend to be an architect helped me just say "No, BG, sorry, whatever you say it will rain".  I suspect others (Bob Faust, Herb Green, Bart Prince, to name a few, had many similar experiences, and I saw Bob Bowlby go through them!).
</p><p>
At any rate we decided to set something up to see if we could improve the
operation a bit, and launched a little "firm" with me as a (very junior)
partner, an actual letterhead, and a few formalities.  I believe we did do a
bit better at seeing that there were contracts with clients, slighly more
formal arrangments involving supervision, and I even tried to "study up" a bit
on state laws, AIA recommendations for office practice, all those lovely things.
</p><p>
One client (for one of his most beautiful designs ever, not very well known it
seems, in California) talked with me quite a lot about it.  He said "you have
got to learn to hide him away from the clients and let them see 'the great
man' only at arranged times and through a window.  He is so plain and so nice
that they realize he will say "yes" to anything they want".  He did not mean
to the design, he meant to little questions like "Can we have gold leaf on
the walls? Can we have 	10 bedrooms and 6 baths for $20000?" and those sorts
of things.  Of course those of us who knew BG can imagine such an arrangement
meeting his desires. His clients quickly became his friends and remained so
forever after, and that is a majaor part of his amazing charm.  But to those
who sometimes had to "pick up the pieces" (usually when the budget began
to fall apart) it might have seemed a good idea.

</p><p>
It turned out that I became reasonable competent (my opinion) at dealing
with potential builders, and especially plumbers and electricians and the
like, and it is still one of my fondest memories of driving up and down
and all around in some small town somewhere trying to find folks who
agreed that installing a toilet in a round bathroom should cost the same
as in a square one (they often didn't realizing that layout could be a
problem for those who didn't understand geometry, and the mathematician
in me helped out with that - I still remember builders in a small town
who decided I was a genius because I not only knew about the 3-4-5 way
of getting a right angle but also about the 5-12-13 version!).

</p><p>
In another note I describe how BG presented things to clients, which was
a beautifully orchestrated dance that very seldom failed - off hand I do
not recall any time that a client turned down a design).  He taught me how
to do this as well, and on one or two occasions even let me handle the
presentation, which was a great thrill and compliment in my estimation.
</p><p>

The move from Bartlesville to Kansas City a bit later was related to this.
There had been some nice newspaper publicity, and some prominent local
architects were interested (that fell through, although the buildings he
would have been involved with were actually built).  There were also better
transportation connections (especially for those who did not like to drive
across one-way bridges:-). The University of Kansas was "nearby" (relatively
speaking - I later received my doctoral degree after commuting for more
than an hour each way and only 3 years), and they had expressed interest
in an arrangment for him to have "master sessions" or something similar
each semester that would have supplied at least the base money for him to
live on.
We did get some things done, of course not nearly as much as we hoped.  I am not
going to go into why things did not happen since I am not sure I even understand that myself.

</p><p>
  At some point during this time I realized that the
arrangment was not going to work as well as it should, and with his blessing
decided to return to my original notion of a career.  At age 5 our town
librarian had decided that I would "go to Rice" (which in those days had no
tuition and thus was a school my family could afford).  At age 16 they accepted me (as did MIT and CalTech but they were certainly not within my financial
reach) and I went there. Literally on my first day there I met Herb Greene and Bob Bowlby and Dick Whittaker, and learned about BG, and 2 years later left
school to work with him and 4 years after that was his "partner".

</p><p>
To end this diversion, no school was very interested in me since I had been
"out" for 8 years.  By chance I met Fr. Doyle, chair of the math department
at Rockhurst College (a small Jesuit school near where we lived) who turned
out to be just about as much a character as Goff (my life has been blessed
that way).  He said "Clearly you should be a mathematician and we need to get 
you a doctoral degree as soon as we can", recommended me for a wonderful
fellowship at the University ok Kansas, and within 3 semesters I had finished
my BS degree and was well on my way toward the PhD degree I received in the
minumum 3 years.  Thus I have actually only been in school
a total of 6-1/2 years, beaten of course by BG's record of O years!
</p><p>
The chair at Kansas by the way was another "character",
who many people saw as a "fuddy-duddy" since he had been chair for 30 years,
but could not have been kinder than he was to me. The trick was he would
never waive a rule himself, but he would find someone else who would waive the
rule for  you! Learning this trick helped me much later in my 21 years as
chair of my own department. The year before I received my degree I ran into
him on campus and apologized for running into so many problems, mostly based
on the fact that they imagined no one would actually get through so fast.
He said "well, you're not the first unusual student we've ever had and I certainly hope you won't be the last.  On the whole they've done rather well". He 
probably did not realize what a lift it gave me to hear that - or maybe he did.
</p><p>
As far as "my influence on BG" you can tell that his on me was transforming.
I am content to believe that I was of help to him in getting a few things
built, in helping him sort out some issues at a time when he was down.  He
was fortunate much of his life in attracting other individuals that helped
in various ways, and I can speak for all of them in saying he is the most
unique person they have ever encountered, and also in may ways the best.
Some folks wish he had been nore "ambitious" perhaps, or "tougher", or
whatever their expectations may have been, all those who knew him well
can say is that they will never forget him and always respect what he did.
