<h1 align="center">This site</h1>
<p>
This will be a web site with materials related to my assocation for many
years with the greatest person (in many ways) I have ever known.  I am much
aware that sentiment is shared by many who were fortunate enough to know him.
</p>
<p>
The preparation of the site is prompted by a gathering which is being held
in London at the Tate Gallery to honor his memory.
</p>
<blockquote>
All these materials for the moment are not even rough drafts, so you should
not be reading them unless I have suggested it.  I put these things up first
for me to see, and they are in the process of being produced and organized
as you read (or hopefully don't read).  You have been warned!

These two relate primarily to our personal and professional relationship.
Nothing exciting or important, just a chance to set it down.

This is a longer piece, just sort of a chronological description
of how I connected with BG, and various aspects of that connection,
which still exists, as it does with anyone who ever knew him.
</p>
<p>
It is not part of any formal analysis of his work, or anything else,
to be read only if the history holds some interest for you, along
with my random thoughts.

This is here just to attempt a bit of an explanation of the more formal
aspects of our relationship (and maybe to explain that while I always
felt it a bit uncomfortable to be described in a formal way as a
"partner" or even "associate" in the sense that the term is used in
architecture, it certainly simplified dealing with immediate issues
of who could decide what when.

Since I claim to have known him well these sections are things I
observed about him that it seems to me would be important to others.
They may give a different perspective than most have given, in part
because I was not in (any of) his profession(s).

This is a bit of description of how BG, at least through my eyes and
in my "collaborative interactions" with him, created and presented his
designs for specific clients. These were memorable events for me, especially
realizing that he knew exactly how to "get things accepted", never a trick
for him, but always a serious moment. I may try to add a bit on "Construction",
since I am not sure everyone understands how good he was at dealing with
actual contractors and workmen.  Part of that charm was of course having
bright and capable young assistants (myself excluded since I was an "outsider",
but Bob Bowlby, Bob Faust, Bart Prince, and many others will know who I meant.

This one is a bit more "serious", and is my mostly later attempts at
understanding his approach to design.  Especially as I later learned
after "growing up" on my own both as a professor and a practicioner
of design in a totally different field, I began, and am still beginning
to understand, how much of a system he actually had and how "scientific"
in what is to me the proper sense he actually was.

This is really a topic I am throwing out because I suspect many of his
colleagues may have had some part of a discussion about this with him,
although I have never discussed it with any of them.  I have an email
address, and have been known to respond on occasion!

<h2 align="center">Tales of BG</h2>
<p>
One thing everyone seems to love is to tell stories about BG, just as he
loved to tell us stories about Wright, and Endicott, and all sorts of
other folks he encountered. A few of his stories about them are actually
included.  
</p>
<p>
It is always dangerous to start into stories, because the rest of the time can rreadily become nothing but that!  Even a walk down the street with BG could become an event.  He made sure if you were in a town with older construction that
you noticed every misstep an architect or builder or remodeller might have
made, and usually had a very twisted way of describing it: "see how the drainpipe struggled to get out and then tried to go back" or something similar was
a common pronouncment.  I won't repeat any comments he made about people,
partially because my mind has either made sure to erase or block most of them,
but he always had a "take" on anyone.  These were never intended to be cruel,
and he was very careful that the person described was not aware, but he
knew exactly how to poke pretensions under the ground.

I just couldn't resist adding this story.  Its to me mostly about the effect
of having a paragraph that identified "where I went" in the wonderful book
by David DeLong, but it also characterizes what is was like to work with
him in a variety of ways.  And I suspect the ultimate resolution of what
it seemed to me could have been an enormous problem, actually became
instrumental in seeing that some of the information about him would be
preserved.  He never wanted "followers", but I suspect as an avid reader
himself of biography he would understand how interesting and important such information could (or could not) become later on.
Like most stories this one is funny and sad.

Just a few reminiscences it seemed these notes would be incomplete without.

<h3 align="center">References</h3>
<p>
I have gotten into the (for me good) habit of just starting off about
anything as a link to Wikipedia.  In my particular field the folks who
started it were in fact in the field, and their references have become
better and better (and some think are going to get worse and worse).
Some universities love them (perhaps not so many) and some hate them,
and I have no idea what those in architecture or art think of them.
</p>
<p>
My view is that I am not endorsing the reference, just pointing somewhere
that I have looked and found to point correctly to the other references I might give
And it is somewhere that is likely to be available (at no cost)
to everyone.  So if you don't like what they say look somewhere else.
My late (undergraduate) student and good friend Paul Flaherty is primarily
responsible for the original idea and implementation of AltaVista, the
first great search engine, and now Google has become just an automatic
part of my life, and one that just grazes the value that the Internet can
provide.
</p>
<h2 align="center">The Internet</h2>
<p>
In a 2000 interview (anonymous) about "the impact of the Internet in the next
century" I saw it as two-fold:
<dl>
<dt>No more authoritative references</dt>
<dd>
No more need for "textbooks" and "encyclopedias" that entomb the
answers
(and for that matter professors who don't "profess" but only "expound").
Everyone anywhere now has access to exactly the same "information",
and it is available whenever and wherever they wish to access it.
</dd>
<dt>No more accurate information</dt>
<dd>
This (should) put schools and especially universities into what should
always have been their real business: helping others develop their own
ability to discriminate the value of information and begin to use it
along with their own imagination to create what they need.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
So my references (if any) are in the article as their subject is encountered,
and they are really only to make sure that my spelling agrees with that of
someone else, and that you will have a place to start if you want to follow
the topic further. Its your job to decide whether they are worthwhile or not.
