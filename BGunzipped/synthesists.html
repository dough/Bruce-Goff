The profession of <span><strong class="command">synthesist</strong></span>
</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>
One topic that BG and I discussed quite often, especially in relation to his
ideas about Kebyar as a school, was the idea of a "synthesist".  I have not
discussed this with others so do now know if it was discussed widely, or just
something that he and I shared as an interest.
</p><p>
He saw my possible role at Kebyar as seeing that the "technical" part sort of
got gathered together: one thing he was very good at to me was seeing that the
OU students did "know their craft" technically.  Not ever having been a student
there, or in any architecture school, I do not really know if he did that, but
he certainly talked about making sure it would happen.  Somehow as we discussed
these matters, and as my own interests developed particularly related to music,
we began to discuss creativity in general rather than just in architecture.
</p><p>
Those who knew BG know how catholic (small c, not large) his tastes were:
he really did know a lot about everything, or at least many things you would
never have guessed that he knew.  Some of us may recall that he even designed
book covers for little "encyclopedia" books on all sorts of things around the
time of the depression.
</p><p>
He believed there was a profession to be born called that of "synthesist",
which would be a person that was not a specialist in any field, but someone
who understood a number of fields whose creativity consisted in the ability
to bring others together by understanding how they could and would interact.
We literally discussed how this would not be "jack of all trades and good at
none" but rather someone whose creation consisted in getting the connections
together.
</p><p>
The example he always adduced, and that we discussed many times, was
Sergei Diaghilev (if you think "who" type some approximation of the name into Google and learn all you wish). He is usually descibed as a great "cultural
impresario" but BG pointed out that his involvment was more than that of
some kind of an event promoter, he actually knew and understood an amazing
amount about the artists involved and how and who from the best interactions would result.
</p><p>
We discussed (in the light of my own interests in science) something I already
believe very much, that such individuals are desparately needed (of course some exist).  In science they are too often seen as merely great organizers, say
for the Manhattan project or more recently various human genome endeavors,
but BG felt they could be more (or is it less?) than that.
</p><p>
Related to this was "multisensual" (we did not have a word) productions that
would involve highly coordinated light, sound, and other senses (motion,
smell, temperature).  When I left Rice to join him one project I hoped to,
but never did, accomplish, was to set Shelley's Prometheus Unbound (believe it or not) with (electronically generated) sound, various kinds of voice, but more
importantly temperature and atmosphere control and motion of the theatre
seats and so on.  It was a dream and who knows if I could ever have done it
(transistors would have helped - "tube" electronics is hard, expensive,
energy consuming, as I had the opportunity to discuss with Edgard Varese one lovely evening with BG).  I did try a few experiments under BG's generous
sponsorship and it was thrilling to observe the response you could get from
folks just using very low frequency sounds to create disturbing vibrations
that they did not even realize were occuring).
</p><p>
In science in a small way my department at MU relates to this sort of thing.
We are just starting a doctoral program (stemming from an earlier program
begun under my tenure as chair) in which we focus on helping folks combine
math and computing to make discoveries in other areas of science.
</p><p>
It is often said of Varese that he "spend the majority of his life waiting for technology to catch up with him".  In some ways that could be (but seems not to be) said about BG: can anyone imagine what he would have done with fractals in his "painting".  To me he is the one person who could see what really should happen with them.
