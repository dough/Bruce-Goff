Just for orientation I am dividing the time I spent somewhat formally
associated with BG into 4 periods:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
1956-1958: in school at Rice Institute in Houston, first relationship
</li><li>
1958-1962: in Bartlesville, getting involved in the architecture
</li><li>
1962-1965: becoming "partner", getting things done, to Kansas City
</li><li>
1965-1969: slowly going on my own
</li></ul></div>
There is another period which should be titled "the rest of my life"
during which we remained close friends, and during which I have realized
more and more the enormous impact he had upon me (and of course upon
many others).
</div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id259093"></a>meeting BG</h3></div></div></div><p>
I first learned of Bruce through Herb Greene.  I arrived in Houston, Texas in
September, 1956 as freshman student at Rice Institute  (now Rice
University), intending to study electrical engineering.
I was living with an aunt and uncle and on my very first evening in their
garden apartment my aunt told me of a wonderful exhibit of paintings
next door hosted by Herb Green, along with Bob Bowlby and Dick Whittaker, who
were all working as local architects.  That next-door visit changed my life
forever.
</p><p>
The paintings were all over the walls of the two adjacent garden apartments
shared by Herb and his then-wife Mary, and Bob and Dick.  Never having
been particularly consumed by art the paintings seemed wonderful to me, since
it one was encouraged to just look at them, think whatever thoughts they inspired,
and merely enjoy the sensation, or not.  This led to an intense desire to learn and
understand more about the individual Bruce Goff who could produce such work.
</p><p>
That same evening, astonishingly, I also learned that Herb had just become
interested in the work of Alfred North Whitehead, whose book "Adventures of
Ideas" had come to my attention during the preceding summer.
This led to a lifelong interest in Whitehead by both Herb and myself, and Herb's great book on
theshows the impact it had on him and
the understanding he developed.  For myself that influence led to a decision
on my part to become a professional mathematician, which to me represented
the ultimate in creativity since there are no external constraints on what
can be done.
</p><p>
Soon much of my life was spent in discussions alternately of Goff and of
Whitehead, or of both.  I was informed that Goff would be in town soon
for a talk (at the University of Houston, I believe) and that he would bring
with him the exciting plans for a shopping center 
called "Circle Tower" (shockingly never built:-)
in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where he was then living.  The first meeting
with him was overwhelming.  As Herb has noted he was very very kind and it
amazed me that all of us could just discuss things naturally without worrying
about what aesthetic theory supported our thoughts.  At B.G.'s invitation
I determined to visit Bartlesville over Thanksgiving vacation and see the
 sights.  

</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id259538"></a>meeting the buildings</h3></div></div></div><p>
The McCullough house was being constructed at the time in
Wichita Falls, Texas, which was near to my home in Denison, and Mr. Goff
was planning a supervision visit along with Haskell Culwell, the builder
(who was also building the original Guggenheim Museum at the time, and
had also built the Price Tower where Mr. Goff was living).
So I joined those two for a trip to Bartlesville, stopping through Norman
to visit the Bavingers, Sapulpa to visit the Frank family, and in Tulsa
for a tour through the Boston Avenue Church.  Each of these visits, 
especially the latter, was accompanied by explanations of what and why
regarding the design, and stories about Ianelli and others at the Church.
Anyone who has been to those places will understand and appreciate the
impact of the trip, especially with Mr. Goff himself as guide.
</p><p>
In Bartlesville the impact was even greater on seeing all the "goodies"
(for want of a better word).  Books, records, paintings, drawings: the
fortunate among us know what it was like.  The two hour sessions listening
to  music
at night were amazing, and very meaningful to me, since I had long been
interested in music. Bob Bowlby had gone to Bartlesville to work with
Mr. Goff, beginning a long and solid career as a highly valued colleague
and friend of Goff's and a kind friend to me. 
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id259746"></a>notions about Kebyar</h3></div></div></div>
TO BE EXPANDED
<p>
Like many of us, especially the Friends of Kebyar, we had many discussions
of the ideas behind that dream, and hopefully with my particular perspective
regarding mathematics and science in general some of those discussions
centered on how such endeavors might be compatible with the creative
dream behind Kebyar.  It is perhaps most appropriate to say here that
it eventually seemed that dream would not and perhaps could not or even
should not come to fruition, but it certainly has remained a wonderful
and inspirational ideal for many.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260545"></a>The book on design</h3></div></div></div><p>
At the time Mr. Goff believed himself to be writing a book on Design
based on the "273" course he had taught at the University of Oklahoma.
He tried out some of it on me, and the small bit I absorbed of his
approach to teaching has been and remains a major inspiration to me
in my 40 years of teaching. Anyone who does not understand that in both
mathematics and in computing creativity is absolutely vital does
not understand either field.
</p><p>
As part of learning to be a decent helper on the book BG had me go through
excercises similar to those the students followed: do me a drawing
expressing "counterpoint", without any previous examples of illustrations
of what that might mean.  He really did want you to begin to believe
that you could actually "create" in literally "your own" style, without
him telling you in advance what should be the result.
</p><p>
In my own teaching (for 40 years) I realize I have followed a version of
this approach.  I refuse to have prerequisites for classes, even graduate
classes, in computing, and explain to the students that the field is
advancing so rapidly that we are all always "lost".  So I encourage them
to just jump in and start trying things, and not become upset as they
"fail".  Of course they need someone "behind" them who can prevent a
succesfully suicide attempt, but in the end they begin to develop a
confidence that they can sort things out, in our case usually by the
end of the semester.  They need to understand that they are most likely to
be hired to do things their employer does not know how to do, so they
may as well learn to sort things out "on their own".  Its perhaps not
about creativity in precisely the same way as "273", but it does develop
a confidence that they can create on demand if they have to. 
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260594"></a>Back at school</h3></div></div></div><p>
After my return to reality, and school, the latter seemed a bit dull.
Besides the University had just decided to adopt their version of the
British "college system" (thus grafting something that had developed
naturally over several hundred years into a school founded in the
1920's in Houston, Texas) and I had no desire to participate. I returned
to Bartlesville on every vacation period and spend much of my energy
(waking and sleeping) thinking about the changes that were occuring in
my life.  I had no dream to become an architect or even an artist (although
I did later make some attempts at musical creation with electronic
instruments I designed and built myself - a very kind Edgard Varese listened
to some of those at one point and made nice comments - a surprisingly kind
Harry Partch also was supportive in his own way) but this taste of the
creative life left me searching for my own path.
</p><p>
A chance soon arose to become involved in a legitimate project in Bartlesville
over the summer.  Mary Greene as an English teacher had read over some  papers
I produced for school, and determined me to be a very good editor, and she
suggested Goff would make better progress on his book if someone were 
available to take it down and suggest edits as he wrote.  Herb appeared to
agree, and this led to my first real involvment in Goff's work itself.
We did produce an interesting series of articles for a German architecture
magazine called Bauwelt (I believe - my copy is gone), and much discussion
about the "273 book" - which I learned had been under production for quite
a long time - and I know from my own experience a long time can be forever
when working on a book).
</p><p>
I arrived in Bartlesville at what seemed an exciting moment: the
Price Studio was apparently imminent, and several small works were
underway, mostly under Bob Bowlby's excellent eye. Soon it seemed that
my mathematical ability might be helpful in other ways: what seemed a
difficult technique of "no point" perspective for laying out renderings
seemed a simple natural technique to me, and after Bob showed me 
"moment distribution" and things of the sort I immediately picked up a
copy of Hardy Cross's book, later the works on structural engineering
of Timishenko and others, and found new mathematical friends. So that
summer was spent very productively on a bewildering variety of endeavors.
</p><p>
After returning to school for my second year (I had changed my major
from Electrical Engineering to Math after learning what that field
could involve) it just began to seem dull.  It isn't
that I did not like the field, but Rice at the time was not what it
later became, and the kinds of math that I loved were rarely discussed.
Also there was a dream of being involved with Kebyar and thinking of
what kind of science and mathematics (and engineering) would be most
appropriate for that environment, not to mention some dreams of creating
electronic music and what B.G. talked about as "synthesis": productions
that would be a modern version of what Diaghlev had done so many years
before with the best of every field: Nijinkski, Stravinsky, Leon Bakst,
and so on.  So at the end of the academic year I turned for a while away
from school (although not from mathematics: now I could read what I wished,
partially due to BGs willingness to fund the books and the time),
and went to Bartlesville for an extended stay.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260688"></a><span><strong class="command">1958-1962:</strong></span>
Getting involved in the architecture
</h3></div></div></div><p>
My natural interests too often are in just about anything: its a blessing
and a curse, so of course I began to take an interest in what was going on
around me.  I began to "help out" with supervision of some aspects of
construction, a bit of engineering here or there, and even learned a bit
about working drawings (and too much about writing specs - or is it "finding
old specs to copy".  BG was wonderfully supportive of whatever I wanted
to do, and I read a lot of math books, designed and built machines for
creating electronic music (just before transistors showed up - if you
know what a "B+ power supply" is you know all about the problems of
using tubes, and the impossibility of producing stable oscillators
with them, and thus the frustration of someone who wanted to use
"low frequency beats" in their music.
</p><p>
I had also begun driving BG around (although much less I am sure than
the sainted Phil Welch had done in the past"-), which gave many opportunities
to talk, and had then begun to go solo on inspection trips to remote
sites (including an intersting 2 weeks in Las Vegas backstage at the Stardust
Hotel doing research - really - for the sadly never built Viva Hotel.
This structure, by the way, appears to have won an award some years ago
from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce for the "most beautiful building
ever designed but not built for Las Vegas" - and I think it would have
been exactly that.  I did a layout for an interior perspective - not so easy -
which unfortunately so far as I know BG never rendered).
</p><p> Just as we were to begin construction on the Redeemer Lutheran
Church Education Building the "apprentice in charge" Art Dyson suddenly
left (at least to me it was sudden), and there was no one around to deal
with it, so I decided to try stepping in.  Since the Building Committee,
although wonderfully nice, consisted mostly of chemists and engineers
who worked for Phillips Petroleum I did not realize that it was not
necessarily an endorsement of me that BG was happy to let me take over
dealing with the committee. The experience turned out to have been wonderful
for me as an introduction to what being a department chair would later turn
out to be:-
</p><p>
I also remember my "introduction by fire" when at the meeting to decide
on the bids and construction contract, the group seemed to come up with
the bright idea that since they were letting the subbids themselves,
perhaps they could just find another  mechanical contractor who would
"do it for less".  And I remember vividly their reaction when this 18 year
old kid, who seemed to be replacing their wonderful and experienced
architect, told them "You can't do that." and when they asked why said
"Because its not ethical".  I have learned more since then about diplomatic
ways to express such truths. They immediately called BG and insisted he
replace "the kid" with someone who knew about the real world, and to his
eternal credit he told them he would not, if they insisted they would have
to get another architect. That is something I remember: his integrity
was real!  He later told me of somewhat similar situations in his own
youth and the ways in which Rush, Endicott, and Rush had supported him.
</p><p>
So my first "job" turned out fine, and many years later on one Saturday
as my daughter and I were going through Bartlesville and stopped in on
an afternoon so she could see it, the lady in charge asked "who I was"
and I just took her to the plaque that BG, Ed Hansen, and I had placed
with our names on it, because we had patiently "glued on the tile" to
cover the joints in the ash plywood entrance and turn it into a very
beautiful (and very inexpensive)  mural.  No one ever equalled BG's
inventiveness in this regard.
</p><p>
At this point I just said "if you believe I can do it I will just
take on the responsibilities of an apprentice, even without my degree"
(something you can imagine  never bothered him!) "and see what i can do".
So that die was cast.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260798"></a>Frustrations</h3></div></div></div><p>
I had begun to realize some of the frustration of Bruce Goff through
our many conversations and some of the events observed or experienced.
This realization led to many conversations and some actions, and especially
I tried to help him determine some choices he needed to make.
