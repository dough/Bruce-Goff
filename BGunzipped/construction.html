Undoubtedly many architects are good "on the site" and many others
never visit, or are even very happy to turn everything after the
drawing over to someone else.  There is no question that BG was
sometimes hard to find when there were problems in construction,
or even when it was time to "write specs", or to sort out the details
of a flashing.  Besides, in the latter case it was going to have to
be done all over again on the site after construction when the leak
was discovered. And you don't need stories of folks like myself crawling
around in the roof valleys with a hose trying to pinpoint the leak.
</p><p>
But some of the "tricks" that I did observe struck me as evidence at
least of someone who cared much how things were actually done, and had
more insight than many into getting it done.  It may be that if he had
performed more large commissions he would have needed or would even have
been forced not to perform his tricks.
</p><p>
So the following two observations are "stories" and should be under the
"tales" section of the site, but I think they illustrate enough about
his approach that they fit well in the present location.
</p><p>
BG was seldom "demanding" in his mannerisms with workmen.  He explained
this to me in terms of a story that he learned early in his apprenticeship
with Rush, Endicott, and Rush. One of the senior members of the firm took
him out to a site to show him "how to supervise".  As it happens a steamfitter
was working on a vertical pipe, and they observed that it in fact was not
exactly vertical.  At this point the senior member began to berate the workman
for the sloppiness of the work, saying "You are not going to get away with
work like that on my  job", with an aside to young Goff that "this will show
you how to treat them". After enduring this for a bit when there was a moment
and then the workman (in a Swedish accent in BG's attempt at mimicry) said
"Ya done?" and laid the uninstalled pipe down.  Mr. Goff said his mentor
was totally correct, he did learn exactly what (not) to do.

The other story I personally observed, and it helped me to realize what a
master psychologist he could be.  When construction was beginning on the
original Price studio, which as all can see involved some very difficult
masonry with coal and glass cullets, Mr. Goff invited all the masons and
their wives to stop in at his office and residence in the Price Tower.
Everyone in Bartlesville was curious about the building, and especially
the residences inside, since few had seen them, so the event was well attended.
Of course Mr. Goff's own space was filled with exotic items such as the
Siamese "phoenix bird" that would be occupying a place of honor, difficult
to construct, in the building.  Somehow he just happened to have many of
his books open (and I vaguely recall that we even had a slide show of various
minor works like Angkor Wat, Sagrada Familia, and perhaps Egyptian 
temples).  The loyal wives of the workment soon began supportive comments
like "I'd like to see Jim try to build that!" which soon led the men to
begin muttering "Huh, I can do more than that" and "Wait until you see
what we are going to build".  Well, thats it, they were committed and
that is what BG wanted.  It really happened and the masons were happy
to have help from the architect (and Bob Bowlby especially as I recall)
in figuring out how to do what they had told their wives would be easy.

Wright I suspect had his own way as well with workmen.  The story I
remember related however to the client.  When the Price Tower was being
built it turned out that the window mullions which were part of the 
aluminum frames for the windows had gotten a bit heavy and were not at
all as light as had been hoped (and in my first trip with Goff and
Haskell Culwell - the builder of the Tower - I recall them discussing
how and why this happened).  At some point it became obvious to all and
Mr. Wright himself was called to the job to solve the problem that had
now become apparent.  He looked things over, called for a painter, had
a red (you can guess the shade) stripe painted on the middle of the three
mullion strips.  When in fact the mullions did not appear much lighter
than before Mr. Wright, ever the master, said loudly and triumphantly
"Once again Frank Lloyd Wright you have seized victory from the jaws of
defeat".  Mr. Price (Joe and Harold Price's father who commissioned
the building) was apparently pleased with the work of the genius he
had chosen!
</p><p>
This leads me to the belief that Wright really might have been a great
President for our country.  Nobody apparently ever thought of asking
how it was that they had ended up in those jaws in the first place.
Its something that BG could never have accomplished, he was just too gentle.
</p><p><b>Doug the student. </b>
One thing I believe I learned to accomplish rather well from experience
and stories from Mr. Goff, that served us in reasonably good stead,
was how to go wherever the jobs existed and find someone to build the
designs.  I remember many many trips to remote places (Beaver Oklahoma
for the Dace and Barby houses, even Redwood City and everything else
along Hiway 101 for the Rudd house) and travelling up and down to obscure
locations (without a GPS - what an effect that has had).  You always
learned to just sort of "sneak" the drawings out (most assuredly without
showing the perspective) and tell the truth - that some "good old locals"
were trying to get a nice house - or church - done, and see if the contractor
would not agree that it didn't matter whether the toilet or tub was going
into a round room or a rectangular one.  Then when some of the problems
would begin to become apparent  you just agreed "it can't be done" and if
that part was done correctly the workmen could be depended upon to say
"well, wait, maybe if we do this ..." and all of a sudden a solution
appeared.

One related story is of a house that I do not know offhand is even
included in DeLong's compilation of the work.  The parents of the
secretary of a client had seen some of the designs, and the father
decided he "wanted something nice".  So he basically moved the family out of the
house on the farm, moved them into the barn, and got her to get us to
come up (for a great Sunday dinner) and show her father what to do
to remodel the place.  BG felt somewhat "blackmailed" into this, but
he and the Dad got along.  He performed quite a lot of his usual magic
and came up with some great suggestions.  The windows in particular
"had angles" shall we say.  Also there were some issues regarding
wiring and plumbing, and thank God no building code except the state
code, and no inspections.  In sorting out what to do we came up with
the idea of using WireMold for the wiring, running it along the edge
of the windows and mitreing it in a three-way mitre at the base of the
windows (I like to believe this was my idea, since I was a WireMold
devotee). The country electrician was not too sure he could mitre
WireMold like wood, but was willing to give it a try, and it worked.
It may not have been "great architecture" but the client sure ended up
happy.
