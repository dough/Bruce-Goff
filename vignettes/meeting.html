<h1>Meeting the work and later BG</h1>
<h2>The work</h2>
The first day I arrived in Houston, to live with
my Aunt Betty and Uncle Ralph, she took me to the apartment next door
to see some art being exhibited in the apartment of Herb and Mary Greene,
and the apartment next to this occupied by Bob Bowlby and Dick Whittaker.
Art to me had beem some dusty <i>Old Masters</i> and architecture some <i>old buildings</i>.
<p>
 I was astonished to find that I did not have to <b>know</b> anything to enjoy
these paintings and could just <b>look</b> and say nothing. Then they began showing me drawings of a proposed development called <i>Circle Towers</i> and a
<b>round</b> apartment building, and it actually made sense.
They talked about the man behind the paintings and the building design
and <b>he</b> made sense.
