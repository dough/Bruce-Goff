<h1 id="meeting">Meeting</h1>
<h2 id="meeting-the-work">Meeting the work</h2>
<p>The first day I arrived in Houston, to live with my Aunt Betty and Uncle Ralph, she took me to the apartment next door to see some art being exhibited in the apartment of Herb and Mary Greene, and the apartment next to this occupied by Bob Bowlby and Dick Whittaker.At that time <strong>Art</strong> was some dusty <em>Old Masters</em> <strong>Architecture</strong>* was some <em>old buildings</em>.</p>
<p>Astonishingly I did not have to <strong>know</strong> anything to enjoy these paintings and could just <em>look</em> and say nothing; as they began showing me drawings of a proposed development called <i>Circle Towers</i> and a <b>round</b> apartment building it actually made sense. They talked about the man behind the paintings and the building design and <b>he</b> made sense.</p>
<p>I stayed until 2 or 3 AM looking at the work, but also because on Herb's drafting table I spotted a copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440366.Adventures_of_Ideas">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440366.Adventures_of_Ideas</a>, a book I had purchased just before I came to Houston thinking it would improve my vocabulary. Herb was (and is) intense but willing to listen as well as talk about BG and Whitehead, the first whoe he knew well and the second we both wanted to know.a</p>
<p>My aunt was thrilled that I was getting cultured already although embarrased that I stayed so long. It would be the first of many nights!</p>
<h1 id="the-person">The person</h1>
<p>BG (I was aalready calling him that before I had met him, since they were) showed up to visit Houston, and was unlike anyone I had ever met:excited</p>
<p>#The place Bartlesville was (and is) a small Oklahoma town.</p>
