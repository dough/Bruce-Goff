I was involved in the early stage, when, after my experience
building a model of the Vernon Rudd house, I built a model of the
glass cullet sanctuary [never built] building. Art FDyson had been
the apprentice who did the working drawings but just after those were
put out for construction bids he suddenly left for other pastures.  BG
was caught a bit short, and since I was familiar with the building and the building committee was familiar with me, volunteered to supervise construction.
I had by that time become familiar with laying out buildings on the site, and
supervising masonry work, so jumped in.
</p><p>
Two big surprises would occur,
the second never revealed before this writing.
</p><p>
The first surprise was that as the bids came in almost close to the budget,
the building committee of respectable and honorable professionals decided
to go out and shop lower bids on some work such as the heating and air
conditioning. The representative of the architect (yours truly) said "You
cannot do that, it is not ethical"! The great architect, of course, was back in his office in the Price Tower while these mundane matters were being discussed.
Upon receiving a phone call that "this kid did not know how business really
worked", the great architect backed me up! The lesson I learned is to find softer ways to say things.
<p><p>
The second lesson, never before revealed, is that when checking out the
engineering details to familiarize myself before construction, it turned
out that no one had really checked  the likely amount of deflection under snow
load, which would have made the roof eventually into a swimming pool. 
What to do, the lowest bid (and only one not far above the original
estimate, was about to be accepted. I so far had not even told BG.
<p><p>
I learned that there is (occasionally) a God!  TYhe "winning" bidders
were Mason and Magana, who had already successfully completed the Comer House
and almost done building the first Price Studio (later known as ShinenKan).
Their initial business had been an aluminum foundry, and the showed up
in the office all excited abou a new machine they had just purchased to
go along with their Heli-Arc welder, which would allow them cut steel easily.
They suggested this would even allow their good friend "BG" to do something
like "cut patterns into beams" if we could persuade him to let them try.
His good friend Doug immediately realized this would move  the flanges of
the I-beams farther apart and avoid the swim, so (for the only time in my life)
said we  will just tell the great man to do this!
Of course I knew he would love it and the cost would never become an issue.
<p><p>
The building still is in fine shape, and turned out well. There was a big
surprise for the HVAC contractor "the kid" had protected. The system was one
he designing with boiler and chiller and modulating valves to control the 
temperature, very fine for a small building with variable occupancy. But when
the held their first Sunday in the building, using the middle space as 
sanctuary, the noise of the HVAC system was deafening, and the ideas were legion.
the "kid" eventually went into the basement and noticed that the big brass
modulating valves had arrows that did not seem to match the flow of water. 
Of course the contractor said "it does not matter" and the kid had to contact
the valve vendor Minneapolis-Honeywell and be assured that "it does matter"
and all four valves had been installed backwards! They call it "valve chatter"
when they try to move.
<p><p>
Lots of detailed stories. The kid learned that any architect, great or not,
needs help. Mr Goff began his career as part of a very professional firm
and told me many stories about how the older Rush brother taught him about
professional behavior and construction supervision. Later when he was part of
the partnership Endacott and Goff his engineering partner knew the job well.
Especially with buildings beyond houses a team is required.
