## Things I could do

### NoPoint perspective
I heard about some mysterious method for laying out a realistic iew of
an unusual building, and when they showed me how to do it I thought *but
that\'s just plain old math*, I could do that.

### Moment distribution
Then Bowlby showed me a
mysterious method for figuring out the demands on a beam and I thought
*but that\'s just mathematical relaxation* (which I had heard about in
calculus studies),I could do that.

### Being useful
So to make myself useful I started
doing some of those things, and when BG showed me a little about
rendering itself I tried my first drawing, of a small house (never
built) for Dick and Phyllis van Dall, and then used my newly found
layout skills (and my never found rendering skills) to take on an
interior perspective of a real (never built) masterpiece for the
writer Al Dewlen and his wife.
