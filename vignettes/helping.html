<h2>Things I could do</h2>
<p>
I heard about some mysterious method for  laying out a realistic iew of
an unusual building, and when they showed me how to do it I thought <i>but that's just plain old math</i>, I could do that. Then Bowlby showed me a mysterious
method for figuring out the demands on a beam and I thought <i>but that's  just
mathematical relaxation</i> (which I had heard about in calculus studies),I could do that. So to make myself useful I started doing some of those things, and when BG showed me a little about rendering itself I tried my first drawing, of  a
small house [never built] for Dick and Phyllis van Dall, and then used my newly
found layout skills (and my never found rendering skills) to take on an interior perspective of a real [never built] masterpiece for the writer Al Dewlen and his wife.
