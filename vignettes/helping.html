<h1>Communicating: A Language</h1>
<h2>The syntax</h2>
<p>What if I told you that the structure of any communications networks
is describable as a single word, made up of just the letters P and e, alternating?</p>
<p>Some examples would be <em>PeP</em> and <em>PePe</em>, but not <strong>PeeP</strong>!</p>
