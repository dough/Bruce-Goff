<h2 id="things-i-could-do">Things I could do</h2>
<h3 id="nopoint-perspective">NoPoint perspective</h3>
<p>I heard about some mysterious method for laying out a realistic iew of an unusual building, and when they showed me how to do it I thought <em>but that's just plain old math</em>, I could do that.</p>
<h3 id="moment-distribution">Moment distribution</h3>
<p>Then Bowlby showed me a mysterious method for figuring out the demands on a beam and I thought <em>but that's just mathematical relaxation</em> (which I had heard about in calculus studies),I could do that.</p>
<h3 id="being-useful">Being useful</h3>
<p>So to make myself useful I started doing some of those things, and when BG showed me a little about rendering itself I tried my first drawing, of a small house (never built) for Dick and Phyllis van Dall, and then used my newly found layout skills (and my never found rendering skills) to take on an interior perspective of a real (never built) masterpiece for the writer Al Dewlen and his wife.</p>
