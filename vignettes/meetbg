## Meeting the work
The first day I arrived in Houston, to live with my Aunt Betty and Uncle
Ralph, she took me to the apartment next door to see some art being
exhibited in the apartment of Herb and Mary Greene, and the apartment
next to this occupied by Bob Bowlby and Dick Whittaker.At that time
**Art** was some dusty *Old Masters*
**Architecture*** was some *old buildings*.

Astonishingly I did not have to **know** anything to
enjoy these paintings and could just *look* and say nothing;
as they began showing me drawings of a proposed development called
<i>Circle Towers</i> and a <b>round</b> apartment building it
actually made sense. They talked about the man behind the paintings and
the building design and <b>he</b> made sense.

I stayed until 2 or 3 AM looking at the work, but also because on Herb's
drafting table I spotted a copy of https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440366.Adventures_of_Ideas, a book I had purchased just before I came to Houston thinking
it would improve my vocabulary. Herb was (and is) intense but willing to listen as well as talk about  BG and Whitehead, the first whoe he knew well and the
second we both wanted to know.a

My aunt was thrilled that I was getting cultured already although embarrased
that I stayed so long. It would be the  first of many nights!

# The person
BG (I was aalready calling him that before I had met him, since they were)
showed up to visit Houston, and was unlike anyone I had ever met:excited 

#The place
Bartlesville was (and is) a small Oklahoma town.
