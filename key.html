Even reading the title I just chose fills me with trepidation:
who except the man himself could choose such a title, and anyone
who believed he actually understood himself would be a fool.  I can
assure you BG was no fool.
</p><p>
So what is better is to tell you that these are just some observations
from someone who had a chance for an acquaintance over a substantial
period of time. If you would like to deduce something else go ahead,
he was substantial enough to support many analyses, and none of them
could possibly encompass his whole.

This is the first key.  Mr. Goff would never have claimed to be a "follower"
in any way of anyone, and if he had ever claimed to be a "follower" of
Debussy he more than anyone would have expected a bolt of lightning from
the French section of heaven to strike him down. And since he and Debussy
(most of the time with Goff, all of the time so far as I know with Debussy
were not in the same creative field there is little danger of confusion
of their work).  But any time I have ever thought of something that Mr. Goff
said some quotation from 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DzfNCmLtEOIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=monsieur+croche&amp;source=web&amp;ots=78k5_WpXQv&amp;sig=-Tdm9h5c4q3pyp7kDNYsYEZ7VZ0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA16,M1" target="_top">
Monsieur Croche, the Dilettante Hater
</a>
immediately springs to mind. What a meeting it would have been (or may still be going in wherever beyond earth they both may be) if the two had ever gotten
together.
</p><p>
Perhaps you should read
Phil Welch's wonderful
<a href="Conversations-Lectures-Philip-Welch/dp/0806128682" target="_top">
Goff on Goff</a>
to learn more about "what made the man tick".  The compiler of that volume
had the opportunity, as I much later did, to be the friend who drove
Goff on many long trips around the country on which there was nothing to
do but talk, or better, listen, and learn more about him and  his ideas.
He also was a student formally, a trusted photographer, and valued colleague.
Phil would never presume to tell you what made Goff tick, but he sure
could tell you about the indicators that he was ticking.
</p><p><b>Varese and Goff on Debussy. </b>
I had the good fortune on two separate occasions to be present when
Bruce Goff visited the composer Edgard Varese in his brownstone in
the Village, and part of their discussion was about Debussy, who Varese
had known as a young man in Paris, and who had enormous influence on
Varese as well as Goff. All that is important here is to note that 
all present agreed the meeting would indeed have been one of
like minds.
</p><p>
The point of bringing Debussy up before making my further remarks
is that a central part of BG was the fact that he never wanted followers
in any sense, that he was always very dubious about critics, not just of
himself but critics claiming to explain anyone, and that he "learned this
trade" from Debussy in the persona of Croche.  He was as willing, and
more able, than anyone to analyse the work of himself or of others,
but understood that was only a beginning at a total stab in the dark,
and not the end of anything.
</p><p>
And it is also the core of his strong belief that each creation should
be fresh, in fact must be fresh to really matter.  He, like Debussy,
understood very well the literal details of other works, even the "theory"
or "style" of the great masters of the respective professions, but he
also understood why the style mattered much less than the work.
</p><p>
One memory that has stayed with me is when discussing the work of the
composer John Cage, and someone (I believe Varese, but could be wrong,
it might have been "just BG") said "It sounds good on paper!".  That said
it all, and the visual version often "said it all" about a large number
of architectural creations, to him.

The second key is the humanity of Mr. Goff, in all of its aspects.
</p><p><b>kindness and students. </b>
You may wonder what the word is doing as a key to a discussion of a 
"great man".  Aren't they supposed to be fierce?

First recall that a major part of his greatness was(is) his effect upon
those who were trying to learn.  I believe I speak for many who knew him
as a teacher that there was never a person who appeared interested in
anything he could help with who he did not try to help.  He absolutely
acted as if anyone could create and refused to judge their talent in
advance.

I recall a two-week seminar he taught for the University of Oregon one
summer on "Teaching of Creativity".  The seminar was interesting to him
in part because it also featured the cartoonist Virgil Partch, professionally known as VIP, who was the brother of Harry Partch, a composer whose work
Goff admired and supported. Mr. Goff told the group that you cannot
teach creativity, you can only hope that you do not destroy it in the
people you teach. As a professor now for over 40 years that phrase is in
my mind every day.
</p><p><b>kindness and clients. </b>
This is something that does not seem to have been much noticed by the
profession, or misunderstood when it was observed. BG loved people in
just about any form, with foibles and all.  He really wanted his clients
to have what it seemed they desired, and never ever say them as "victims
for the picking" to use their resources to build another monument to
his ego.  For those who say "you could not tell, he certainly tried to
spend their money, he just seldom succeeded" the key thing to notice is
that he was trying to satify them, not himself.  

One of his clients, who went through the disappointments of an incredible
but unaffordable design, then a wonderful design that his family could
not afford, and finally a beautiful design that was finally built, was
giving me advice about helping BG deal with clients.  He said "you have to
keep him more away from clients, or they will get the idea it is actually
possible to have whatever they want.  They will think that in the last
resort he will just fund it himself, and the truth is that if he had the
money he would".  That is quite different from an architect who wants
to construct something himself and will the client as the provider of
resources to get it done.

This is as good a place as any to note what has always seemed to me an
extreme misunderstanding of Goff.  Everyone talks about his use of
"as-found" materials, which all agree was highly imaginative and
resourceful, even if it marks him as "strange" in some eyes. [I
deliberately did not say "idiosyncratic" since that is the actual
word most people use and I did not want to insult those who use the
term].  Believe me, folks, he did not have some fetish about their use,
believing the "as-found" aspect improved his work.  He had NO choice,
given the budgets of most of his clients.  All of us who worked with him
saw him, as the job began winding down and the budget was mostly gone,
head off to Woolworth's or a similar store and start assembling the
"decoration".  It was never "pasted on", he had expected to and planned
for the use of the material, it was just what he could get with the
resources that remained, and often paid for himself.  He absolutely knew,
and said, that diamonds would be better than glass beads (and we used to
joke about diamonds instead of glass cullet), but he really felt he had
to do the best he could, because he knew the effect that would result
would provide an "edge" that clients would enjoy for years to come.
Perhaps he was "simple American" or whatever phrase you prefer because
he was not ashamed to connect beauty and primitive inexpensive materials,
but it was not that his aesthetic taste, or knowledge, was deficient
in any way.  Credit for being imaginative and inventive is due, and to
me it was wonderful that he was no so embarrassed by lack of resource
that he refused to help his clients achieve a dream they might not have
imagined when they came to him.
