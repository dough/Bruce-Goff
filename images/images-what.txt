Lincoln Durst (now Gee) house-Houston, Texas - I was not involved in the
design or construction, ut am responsible for this house, as Bob Durst
(their son) was in my sophomore English class at Rice and went home and told
his parents about Mr. Goff and you can see what happened. It was a surprise,
as his mother was very conservative, but had good sense.

vernon and helen marie rudd house, san mateo, ca -I built a model of the first design,
and oversaw construction of the third design, which was built.

redeemer lutheran church education building, bartlesville, ok -the first
building whose construction I supervised.
I earlier built a model of the sanctuary which was never constructed.

Sooner Park playtower, Bartlesville, OK - supervised construction, and showed hohow to build the Mobius strip.
