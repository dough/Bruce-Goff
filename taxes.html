<p>One story about <em>business</em> summarizes <em>working with BG</em> for me. As some may know (from David deLong’s book perhaps) I <em>did his taxes</em> for years. When I met him they had been <em>done</em> for some time by a lady (Fern Pirtle) who BG knew at OU (she ran the campus bookstore), very nicely and properly, but him remembering to get things to her and then getting them all signed and so on had become a problem in Bartlesville, so I volunteered to do them instead to save us all some energy. Since he was not a <em>success</em> in that worldly aspect of his life perhaps they were never much of a problem. They were a bit irritating since he often gave talks in universities or other places in various states there was this <em>dance</em> of dealing with all the varied withholding rules and so on, and there were a few issues mostly related to the purchase of books that had to be handled as far as depreciation and whatever. TITLEApril 15 every year but one My birthday happens to fall on April 13, so those who know him can imagine that the first I would hear for a particular year about his taxes was on my birthday, when would magically appear little carefully hoarded scraps of papers and receipts, including gas and electric bills, various withholding forms, cancelled checks. And for a small time we actually operated as a partnership since it simplified my ability to handle some details of jobs and such, especially signing simple contracts and such.</p>
<p>After I began my own career as a professor I continued to handle the taxes (not a duty I would have wished upon anyone else: small amounts, but lots of little picky details). So every year I would receive a phone call on my birthday (maybe I would have anyway), along with a special delivery letter filled with the little items mentioned above.</p>
<p>One year he called much earlier to tell me the exciting news that he had sold his 2 Klimt paintings, something he had never done before to my knowledge. He said he had become convinced they should be safely in a museum rather than just hanging on a wall in a house (and there is another story that should be told about the amount of his art work that became damaged living in a “work of art” in Bartlesville which suffered from severe problems of leaky windows and basement!)[can you believe that great buildings often leak?]. I recall very distinctly the sudden chill that came upon me when he told me the amount of the sale, since I happened to be present in 1958, I believe, when the 2 Klimt paintings arrived for a total purchase price of $1000 (800 for the large, 200 for the small): the sale price ended up quite a lot above the purchase price. I begged him several times then and later “BG please do not expect me to handle this in a tax return.You MUST get hold of a tax adviser who knows how to handle such things and follow his advice or you will lose your shirt!” He assured me that “of course” he would do this, and later told me had found “this guy” in Chicago whose name was “Mitchell” who was an expert in such matters and would “handle it all”. I should have sensed something then.</p>
<p>On my birthday I received not a call but the usual little package, except that along with the careful notes on the monthly gas bill (lets say $8.95 in those days) there were copies of 2 cashier’s checks for what to me (then and now) were giant sums, along with some receipts related to government bonds and such from thebrokerage firm Mitchell Hutchins office in Chicago! Apparently “Mitch” did exist but apparently also he had not handled the tax implications to say the least!</p>
<p>After reviewing in my mind why I had become his friend (rather than his associate) I called him in Tyler to sort out what to do, because I was lost. I eventually filed some kind of return, I do not even remember what, that basically excused the non-filing on the basis of some kind of illness (he did say he was not feeling well, sadly enough). We all know that this latter statement ended up true and some months later, to my great surprise and sadness, came his death.</p>
<p>Cut now to some years later, when by that time was chair of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science I was standing in the department office next to a secretary, and we received a phone call from someone in New York who told her “I know that years ago a person named Douglas Harris went to Marquette University in the Mathematics Department. Could you tell me where he might be now or how I could reach him?”.</p>
<p>The secretary laughed and handed me the phone, whereupon the voice in a very angry tone said “Is this Douglas Harris who claims to be a tax adviser?”. Somehow I guessed what it might be since I seldom heard from New York lawyers in my usual capacity and I said “No, this is Douglas Harris who is a professor of mathematics who had a good friend Bruce Goff for whom he mostly did simple tax returns!. There was sort of a gasp at the other end and an exclamation”Oh no, now I understand" and the gentleman went on to explain to me that he had been told of a “tax wiz” who had “taken care of everything” <em>not the “Mitch” I had heard about but “me”</em>. We had further discussion, the gemtleman who was the kind of person I had begged BG to get involved in the first place, really did handle the matter. I ran into him later at the memorial service and we had a bit of a kind reminiscence about the matter.</p>
<p>“Managing BG”</p>
<p>It was always a challenge trying to “manage” events for BG. You basically had to look under his drafting board, in his little tins of marzupan, anywhere else you could imagine, to see if there was a threatening letter from a lawyer or an agreement to design a building conveniently tucked away. It was a certain charming aspect of his personality (really, unless you had some responsibility) and my wife would probably tell you I am mostly that way myself! In cases other than mine its a mark of a mind preoccupied with creating: for me just an absent-minded professor. But doing architecture which involves the dedication and emotion associated with BG tends to intensify situations and so it was always a challenge.</p>
<p>As a department chair for 21 years I know that job is often described as trying to manage a <strong>herd of cats</strong>. Especially if you understand BG’s love of cats and his respect for their independence, you will understand that managing him was precisely the task of * managing a single cat*. <strong> But what an animal</strong></p>
