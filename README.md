# BruceGoff
I had a close relationship with Bruce Goff (BG from now on) for many years.
He initially was a mentor who helped me, in the same way he helped so many others, to realize my creative potential.
A difference from most of those other cases, which he and I were aware of very early on, was that my primary creative interests were not in traditipnal artistic areas, but in mathematics

BG ideas about education, and a dream of his had long been to found a school called Kebyar which would promote creativity. He thought it should not be restricted to architecture or painting or music or any other specific domain, but should encourage each art and especially their synthesis.
