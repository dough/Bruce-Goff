# BruceGoff
I had a close relationship with Bruce Goff (BG from now on) for many years.
He initially was a mentor who helped me, in the same way he helped so many others, to realize my creative potential.
A difference from most of those other cases, which he and I were aware of very early on, was that my primary creative interests were not in traditipnal artistic areas, but in mathematics
