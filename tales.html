Whenever people get together to talk about BG (or Wright or many others -
even though Gaudi seemed "so straight" undoubtedly the "Amigos" get
together to tell tales about him) the "tales" always begin.
These are just some things that I heard of or was involved with that were to
me interesting.  Those who knew BG all are familiar with his ability to
regale a group for hours with his stories, a large number of them actually
true in some sense or another.  I am going to set down a few just to get
them recorded somewhere.  Since I am an "outsider" as I keep reminding you,
they may all be well known, they may be unknown, they may seem or even be
untrue, that is why they are labelled "tales".

So far as I know BG never met Einstein.  He was however close friends while
in Berkeley with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Mendelsohn" target="_top">
Erich Mendelsohn</a> and greatly admired his work.  Mendelsohn himself
was a friend of Einstein and in fact designed the <span class="emphasis"><em>Einsteintunn</em></span> or &#8220;<span class="quote">Einstein Tower</span>&#8221;  which housed the observatory from which
the experiment that confirmed Einstein's Theory of Relativity was done.
</p><p>
As it happened I had become very interested in an alternative theory  by
Alfred North Whitehead and thinking of following that further in some of
my own work, so was busily reading and studying on this topic (and able to
find through contacts BG helped me make at the New York Public Library a
copy of Whitehead's wonderful and rare book "Principle of Relativity". To
sidetrack here for a  moment Sir Arthur Eddington once said that "we now
know Whitehead had the greater insight than Einstein but it came too late
for physics".  If you are a critic please don't say things like that even
if everyone thks they are witty: you might end up seeming the fool yourself
someday.
</p><p>
Being polite, as BG always was, he asked me to try to explain some of this to
him, and told me that Mendelsohn himself had tried at one point.  Somehow
that led to a discussion of the book
"Space, Time, and Architecture" by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Giedion" target="_top">Siegfried Giedion</a> which was (and for all I know still is) the
common textbook in vogue in architecture schools.  BG told me the following
story (I try to be careful about sources, so you can sort out whether this
is second, third, or fourth hand).  I believe BG told me one time that 
Mendelsohn's widow after his death tried to sort out what to do with the
quote, and that a somewhat expurgated version had been published.
</p><p><b>what Einstein said about the book. </b>
Eric apparently read the Giedion book and did not understand what was said
about the title topic, so he sent it (whether the book or just excerpts
I do  not know) to Einstein, with whom he had retained a lasting friendship.
According to the story his letter said something like "Lieber-Meister,
(not Sullivan in this case:-) I thought that I had understood a bit of your
theory as you explained it to me, but if what I read in this book is correct
then I did not understand you at all".

Supposedly Einstein seldom answered important matters in the body of the
letter. but attached a postscript with the important comments.  In this case
the postscript was: "In reference to the material that you asked me to read
I can say that the material was very poorly digested, but very magnificently
shit".  (The last term of course was meant in the sense of an active verb,
as Germans like to do, rather than as an adjective descriptive of the content -
or so you think at first reading).

The first time I went to New York City (the highlight being meeting
Edgard Varese
and his charming wife Louise), I think in 1958 or 1959 when I was perhaps
19 years old, at one point in the middle of the business district as I recall
we went down some steps into a bookstore (crowded with books more than people
as good bookstores often are) and from the rear came a voice immediately said
"Well, Bruce Goff, I haven't seen you since [some long passed date]".  I later
learned that the lady who spoke was very famous for the authors and others
who she had supported in various ways over the years. The name of the store
was ("of course" say those who knew) the
<a href="http://www.finneganswake.org/GothamBookMart.shtml" target="_top">
Gotham Book Mart</a>.  This was the beginning of my realization that
you should never make any assumption about who BG might have known, or
about the depths of his creative interests in just about anything.  Of course
I learned later of his relationship with Rick San Jule and others.  Some of
this can be found I believe in David DeLong's book.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260531"></a>Duke Ellington and Tulsa</h3></div></div></div><p>
This is a story I heard several times in more or less the same form from
BG, and I suspect others have heard a similar story.  As it happens (I am not
sure how many had this experience) he and I had a number of discussions related
to Civil Rights beginning from the article we (he with my editing) wrote for
the German journal (I believe)  called "Bauwelt" in around 1958 - definitely
not Baukunst und Werkform [perhaps excuse my German] in which an earlier article
had appeared). He explicitly discussed issued related to "city planning" such as
building "concrete slums with no grass" in Chicago, and he predicted (I do not remember if this was in the article or not, and I lost my copy of the article when I gave it to a fellow student at Rice to show to his parents, who later had
BG build the Durst (later Gee) house in Houston - a casualty lost to a good cause).
</p><p>
We discussed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Race_Riot" target="_top">
Tulsa race riot</a> in 1921, which he observed first hand both as a young
professional and also as someone whose (obviously white) neighbors had brought
home "trophies" from sacking black neighborhoods.  We several times later
deliberately passed through villages composed of mostly black people who  had
basically fled from Tulsa at the time and never returned.
</p><p>
This led to discussions of race generally in various ways (I am not good at
such discussions, I think the "races" if they ever existed have been so mingled
over the years that nobody is really anything anyway, and who cares.  That could
be confirmed when you understand that when my wife and I married, with BG's very
active support, by the way, the Kansas City authorities decided she was Oriental and I was Caucasian and asked me to confirm this (since it would prevent a legal marriage in Missouri) I refused to play and just said "I have no idea what I am, I don't know enough of my history".  Apparent skin tone won, by the way,
and we had a "duplicate" wedding in the more enlightened state of Kansas across the river).
</p><p>
BG was an early and devoted fan of Ellington's music (and that of other jazz artists of the time, but especially those who seemed "serious"). Apparently Ellington came to town for a concert and upon seeing the Boston Avenue Church wanted to
know who had designed it, and in that way came into contact with BG.  Mr. Goff
in turn learned that the great man could not eat in any "normal" establishment
in Tulsa and took him home for dinner. I believe that his mother Maud, another
person everyone loved because she was so absolutely straightforward, confirmed
this - at least I do remember her saying "Bruce always brought people home to
dinner".
</p><p>
Others could tell the rest of this story better than me, but my memory of what
BG told me is that in the 1950's Ellington was in Oklahoma City for a concert,
called Norman to talk with Mr. Goff, and ended up invited to lecture to a
(presumably delighted, and perhaps somewhat surprised) class on design.
I do recall discussions about Ellington and his music (which had always been
a favorite of mine because I had ambitions during high school of becoming
a jazz saxophonist (and did once "sit in" with Stan Getz - but that is really
getting far off the topic).
</p><p>
Of course the real point of this story is twofold: how broad and catholic
his tastes, interest, and knowledge went, and something less often discussed,
he had very strong and very "correct" views about these matters, based upon
his real personal experiences.  During the riots in Kansas City and elsewhere
following the assassination of Martin Luther King he was even willing to
drive to meetings in a city under martial law (or so it seemed) to discuss
the possibility of donating his services in designing a memorial.
</p><p><b>Added in proof. </b>
I recently ran across a reference to a theatre in Tulsa, in a piece
about the number of famous artists who performed there, among them
Duke Ellington.  It went on to mention that the interior had been
redesigned by Bruce Goff under the architects Rush, Endicott, and Rush.
So there may be a nice story there (and for all I know it may already
be well-known).
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260410"></a>FLLW the charmer</h3></div></div></div><p>
This was one of BG's favorite stories (which for this audience means those
who knew him know it).
</p><p>
At one point Frank Lloyd Wright showed up, I think the story goes in the 
Price Tower, and Mr. Goff's sister and his mother were present.  Mr. Wright
in his charming manner said "Well, Bruce, I'm so happy to meet your beautiful
sister.  I did not even know you had a sister". Upon Mr. Goff then saying
"And, Mr. Wright, this is  my mother" before any more could be said Maude,
the mother, who was suspicious of "charmers" said "Well, I guess you knew
he had a mother". According to Goff a light flashed in Wright's eyes that
showed he knew he had met his match and he said "Well, I strongly suspected
so".
</p><p>
She told  me the same story herself, knowing it bad become a local legend,
and said "I'd seen him on TV.  He was just a spoiled old brat".
</p><p>
Maude made draperies all her life, and was a wonderful person to talk to,
as many of BG's associates knew.  Anything she was willing for you to know
she would tell you politely, but she was a match for anyone as far as knowing
what was going on.  There are some who saw him perhaps as a "mama's boy" or
something, I certainly never did, and he spoke often of his father who was
by that time deceased.  My personal take was that he inherited much of his
middle-western manner and mannerisms from her, and keeping up with her own
dry wit probably had prepared him well for what he encountered later on.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260456"></a>Endicott the Engineer</h3></div></div></div><p>
The middle name in "Rush Endicott and Rush" was that of the structural
engineer, who for a short time was also a partner with BG just before
the depression ended things in Tulsa.  BG's stock in trade as a professor
at OU sometimes appears to have been "Endicott stories" since all his
former students seem to know a bundle of them.  I will not repeat any
of them since others know them much better.  However I will note that we
had serious discussions about what it had been like to work, and partner
with Endicott, and I do know that he maintained great respect for the
man and for their working relationship.
</p><p>
With apologies for even trying to tell someone else's story it was almost
a shock to us when Bob Faust (a very creative former student who is
responsible literally for the existence of the Gutman and Gryder houses)
served in the Navy on board the "carrier Enterprise" (partly as a cartoonist
who apparently ended up knowing everyone on the ship and everyone that they
knew).  He encountered Endicott's son, learning 1) there really was an
Endicott and 2)he was as bad or worse as had been portrayed by BG. The
term "bad" is used mostly as it relates to puns, and many of us thought
BG was the worst.
</p><p>
I will report one of BG's favorite "Endicotisms", which was often of great
help as an explanation during my 21 years as chair of an academic department
and at other assorted times.  Endicott apparently explained that 
"the trouble with the world is that there are a lot more horses asses than
there are horses".  It is a particular satisying explanation to a mathematician.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id260884"></a>The Great Composers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Having started telling "tales from others" I will stop soon or run
out of space on the site.
</p><p>
J. Palmer Boggs was the structural engineer for many of Goff's buildings
and a very good friend and supporter in some difficult times.  He also
became a good friend and very kind mentor to me in regard to his
engineering.  His entire family was just a delight to be around, and
it was always fun to have to "go to Norman" to get some advice about
engineering or construction in general.
</p><p>
A story that BG loved to tell was that at one point in Oklahoma City
the symphony performed a piece at which the actual composer was
introduced, whereupon the voice of one of Bogg's daughters was heard
to say "But I thought all the composers were dead!".
</p><p>
His delight in the story of course was that that is exactly what he thought
every concert organizer believed as well.  He would not even attend
symphonies (except occasionally in Chicago perhaps) although we all know
how much he loved to play his recordings of the latest as soon as it
arrived.  And he knew and befriended and even aided a number of them,
as well as composing music himself.  The whole issue of exactly what he
did and what he knew in that direction appears to be a bit murky, but
the general knowledge (even of the "dead" ones) was staggering in its
scope.  Anyone who imagined there was something he did not know (or perhaps
had known but did not want to remember) often received a rude awakening.
