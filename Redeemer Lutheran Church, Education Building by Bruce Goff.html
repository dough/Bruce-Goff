 <tbody><tr><td colspan="3">This addition to the church was designed specifically for children; thus it is bright and cheerful. The outstanding feature of the building is the use of cullet, or glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted. This aquamarine glass is formed into "ears" at the front corners of the building as well as being interspersed on the outer walls. </td></tr>
